# ADR 0001 — Token storage for launch: keep localStorage-JWT, do not switch to cookie sessions

- **Status:** Proposed (Evan signs off) — 2026-07-16
- **Milestone:** M11 (launch hardening), task M11.1(a)
- **Scope:** v2 only. This is v2's first ADR; v1's 15 ADRs live in the separate v1 repo.

## Context

v2 authenticates with a signed JWT the browser stores in `localStorage` and sends
as an `Authorization: Bearer` header on every authed request. The question for
launch is whether that scheme is safe enough to ship to a platform whose users
include minors, or whether we should switch to HttpOnly-cookie sessions before M11.

Verified reality of the current scheme in **this** codebase:

- **Token minting / TTL.** HS256 JWT via PyJWT, claims `sub` + `tv` + `exp`
  (`backend/app/core/security.py:35`). TTL is **7 days**:
  `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES: int = 60 * 24 * 7  # 7 days`
  (`backend/app/core/config.py:29`). There is **no refresh token**.
- **Storage + transport (client).** Token is written to `localStorage` under
  `servelocal_token` (`frontend/lib/auth-context.tsx:16`, set at `:58`, read at
  `:44`/`:69`) and attached as `Authorization: Bearer ${token}` in the fetch
  wrapper (`frontend/lib/api.ts:48`). Every authed API method takes the token as an
  explicit argument.
- **Server-side invalidation.** `token_version` (int on `User`) is embedded as JWT
  claim `tv` and compared in `get_current_user` (`backend/app/api/deps.py:32`). It
  is bumped on **password reset** (`backend/app/api/routes/auth.py:307`) **and on
  account deletion** (`backend/app/api/routes/auth.py:246`), invalidating every JWT
  issued before that event. It is **not** bumped on logout — `logout()` only
  removes the key from `localStorage` client-side
  (`frontend/lib/auth-context.tsx:72`); there is no server logout endpoint, so a
  copied token stays valid until `exp`.
- **XSS-theft calculus (materially changed 2026-07-16 by the CSP).** The whole
  argument against `localStorage` tokens is that script running in the page can
  read them. That surface is now tightly constrained:
  - CSP header on every route (`frontend/next.config.mjs:17-27`):
    `default-src 'self'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `base-uri 'self'`,
    `form-action 'self'`, `connect-src 'self' <apiOrigin>`,
    `img-src 'self' data:`, `font-src 'self'`. **Production has no
    `'unsafe-eval'`** — it is gated behind `isDev` at `:19` for Next HMR only.
  - `connect-src` is limited to self + the API origin, so even if an attacker
    executed script, exfiltrating a stolen token to an attacker host is blocked by
    CSP (no arbitrary `fetch`/`XHR`/`WebSocket` egress).
  - Remaining CSP gap: `script-src` keeps `'unsafe-inline'` (`:19`). Inline script
    is still allowed, so CSP is not a hard stop against a reflected/stored-XSS
    injection **if one existed**.
  - But the stored-XSS surface itself is minimal: React auto-escapes all rendered
    values and there is **zero** `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in the frontend
    (grep, 2026-07-16; corroborated by the stored-XSS audit 2026-07-15). No
    `v-html`-style raw-injection path exists.
- **No CSRF surface today.** The app sets **zero cookies**; auth rides an explicit
  header, which browsers do not attach automatically cross-site. There is nothing
  for a CSRF attack to ride. A cookie switch would *create* this surface.
- **SSR does not touch authed content.** There is no `middleware.ts`/edge auth
  (glob, 2026-07-16) and `auth-context.tsx` is `"use client"`; every authed fetch
  is client-side with the token passed explicitly. The usual "HttpOnly cookies let
  the server render authed pages" benefit does not apply here.
- **Rate limiting.** Per-IP sliding-window limiter, `/auth/*` at 30/min
  (`backend/app/core/config.py:50`, `backend/app/core/rate_limit.py`), which blunts
  online brute-force / credential stuffing. In-memory / single-process; a shared
  store is already flagged for M11.
- **Minors threat model.** Students frequently use **shared** machines (school
  labs, public library). A token that survives tab-close and stays valid for a week
  is a real-world exposure on those machines — but note this is a *persistence +
  TTL + logout* problem, not intrinsically a *storage-mechanism* problem: a
  non-session HttpOnly cookie on a shared machine persists the same way.

## Options considered

### Option A — Keep localStorage-JWT + Authorization header (current)

**Pros**
- Zero new attack surface: no cookies → no CSRF to defend, no SameSite edge cases.
- The one classic weakness (script reads the token) is heavily mitigated *in this
  codebase*: no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, React escaping, prod CSP with no
  `'unsafe-eval'` and a `connect-src` allowlist that blocks token exfiltration.
- No engineering work on the critical path to launch; nothing new to get subtly
  wrong right before shipping to minors.
- Matches how the frontend already works (client-side fetches, explicit token) —
  no SSR benefit is being left on the table.

**Cons**
- Token is readable by any script that runs in the page; `'unsafe-inline'` in
  `script-src` means CSP is not a hard backstop if a stored-XSS hole ever appears.
- **7-day TTL is long** and there is no refresh/rotation, so a stolen or
  shoulder-surfed token is valid for a week.
- **Logout is client-only** — it does not invalidate the token server-side, so a
  token copied off a shared machine keeps working after the student "logs out."

### Option B — Switch to HttpOnly + Secure cookie sessions before launch

**Pros**
- Token becomes unreadable to page JavaScript (defeats XSS *theft* specifically).
- `Max-Age`/session-scoping can bound persistence on shared machines.

**Cons**
- **Creates a CSRF surface that does not exist today.** Requires SameSite=Lax/Strict
  *and* a CSRF-token scheme for state-changing requests — new machinery, new tests,
  new ways to be wrong, landed on the launch critical path.
- Touches a lot: `security.py` (issue via `Set-Cookie`), `deps.py` (read token from
  cookie), a real server-side logout that clears the cookie, `api.ts` (drop the
  header, add `credentials: 'include'`), `auth-context.tsx` (can no longer read the
  token — hydrate purely from `/auth/me`), CORS (`allow_credentials` + exact
  origins), plus new CSRF middleware and its tests.
- Cross-site `connect-src`/CORS + credentialed requests get fiddly across the
  frontend origin and the API origin (they are distinct today).
- **Does not fix the actual weaknesses** (long TTL, no server logout, shared-machine
  persistence) unless we *also* do the TTL/logout work — which we can do far more
  cheaply under Option A.
- Buys the least where we're already covered (no SSR authed content; CSP already
  blocks exfiltration) and costs the most where it hurts (launch timeline, new CSRF
  risk on a minors platform).

## Decision

**Keep the current localStorage-JWT + Authorization-header scheme for launch
(Option A).** Do **not** switch to cookie sessions for M11.

Reasoning grounded in this codebase, not generic guidance:

1. The single reason to prefer HttpOnly cookies — XSS token theft — is already
   heavily mitigated here: no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, React escaping, and a
   production CSP (`next.config.mjs:17-27`) with no `'unsafe-eval'` and a
   `connect-src` allowlist that blocks exfiltrating a stolen token off-origin.
2. The cookie switch would **introduce** a CSRF attack surface we do not have today
   (zero cookies) and put brand-new CSRF/SameSite machinery on the launch path for a
   platform serving minors — the wrong time to add subtle, security-critical code.
3. The HttpOnly/SSR advantage does not apply: no authed content is server-rendered
   (no `middleware.ts`; `auth-context.tsx` is client-only).
4. The genuine weaknesses are **TTL length and logout semantics, not the storage
   mechanism** — and those are fixable cheaply within Option A (see Follow-ups). A
   cookie migration would not fix them for free either.

The honest flaw we are shipping with: a **7-day token, no server-side logout**, on a
platform whose users share machines. We accept this for launch *only paired with*
the Follow-up mitigations below (TTL tightening + real logout invalidation +
logout-on-401), which close most of the exposure without a storage rewrite.

## Consequences

- We ship on the existing auth code; no auth rewrite blocks M11.
- No CSRF surface is introduced.
- We carry a known, documented residual risk (long TTL / client-only logout) into
  launch, tracked here and addressed by the Follow-ups. If a stored-XSS hole is ever
  found, the token is stealable (CSP blocks *exfiltration*, not *reading*), so the
  no-`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` invariant and CSP must be treated as load-bearing and
  guarded in review.
- Revisit if any of these change: authed content moves to SSR; a third-party
  script/CDN gets added (widens the XSS surface and would need CSP relaxation);
  or session-UX needs (silent refresh, "remember me") push us toward a refresh-token
  design — at which point Follow-up 4 is the migration path.

## Follow-ups (NOT implemented here — orchestrator applies approved items)

Cheap mitigations that keep Option A and close the real gaps. Do not implement in
this ADR task (backend config is being edited concurrently by another worker).

1. **Tighten the access-token TTL.** `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` is 7 days at
   `backend/app/core/config.py:29`. Shorten it (e.g. 12–24h). Tradeoff: with no
   refresh token, a shorter TTL forces more frequent re-login — pick a value that
   balances shared-machine exposure against student UX. This is the single
   highest-value mitigation.
2. **Make logout invalidate server-side.** Today `logout()` only clears
   `localStorage` (`frontend/lib/auth-context.tsx:72`); the JWT stays valid until
   `exp`. Add a logout endpoint that bumps `token_version` (same mechanism as reset
   at `backend/app/api/routes/auth.py:307`, checked at `backend/app/api/deps.py:32`)
   so "log out" actually kills the token — important on shared machines.
3. **Logout-on-401 interceptor.** In the fetch wrapper's error branch
   (`frontend/lib/api.ts:53`), on a 401 clear `servelocal_token` and route to login,
   reusing `auth-context.tsx`'s `logout()`. Prevents a rejected/expired token from
   lingering in a confusing half-logged-in state (and pairs with #1's shorter TTL).
4. **Future — refresh-token rotation.** If/when session UX needs silent renewal,
   add a short-lived access token + a rotating refresh token (a refresh token is the
   one credential that genuinely belongs in an HttpOnly cookie). This is the
   incremental path to cookie-backed sessions *without* the full session rewrite
   Option B implies, and it can be scoped post-launch.
5. **Already tracked:** move the single-process rate limiter to a shared store for a
   multi-process deploy (`backend/app/core/rate_limit.py`, flagged for M11) — matters
   for brute-force resistance on `/auth/*` once we scale past one process.
