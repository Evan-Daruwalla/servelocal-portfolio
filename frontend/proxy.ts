/**
 * Per-request CSP nonce, so `script-src` no longer needs `'unsafe-inline'`
 * (2026-08-07). This closes the gap ADR-0001 recorded as the known weakness of
 * keeping the JWT in localStorage: the token is readable by any script that
 * runs in the page, so CSP is the only backstop if a stored-XSS hole ever
 * appears — and `'unsafe-inline'` made that backstop inert.
 *
 * Next reads the nonce out of the `Content-Security-Policy` REQUEST header and
 * stamps it onto its own inline bootstrap scripts, which is why the header is
 * set on both the request (for Next) and the response (for the browser).
 *
 * The three static security headers stay in `next.config.mjs`; only the CSP has
 * to be built per request, and it must live in exactly one place — a second CSP
 * header would be intersected with this one by the browser, not replace it.
