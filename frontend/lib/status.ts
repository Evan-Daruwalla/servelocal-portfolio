// The one home for status display vocabulary. These maps were defined
// independently in four files, which is how the `withdrawn` pill shipped broken
// (landing-check 2026-08-12): a status added on the backend must appear in
// every map below, and scattered copies get missed. Two DISTINCT domains share
// the word "status" — don't merge them:
//
//   * Application status: pending / approved / rejected / waitlisted / withdrawn
//   * Hours status:       pending / verified / denied / appealed
//
// Adding a status? Update every map in its domain — they sit adjacent so the
// sweep is visible. Pill classes (`sp-*`) are defined per CSS system in
// `app/globals.css` (non-.v1 routes) and `app/v1.css` (.v1 routes) — that
// duplication is the deliberate v1 exact-copy architecture; keys used here must
// exist in BOTH files. `sp-appealed` exists only in v1.css, so hours statuses
// map `appealed` to `sp-waitlisted`, which v1.css styles identically.
//
// NOT sourced from here, deliberately: `applicants/page.tsx` (org dashboard,
// v1-parity surface) renders raw status words via the identity mapping
// `sp-${status}` — its copy register is the org's, not the student's.
